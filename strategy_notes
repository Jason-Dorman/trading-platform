Technical Analysis:
	Technical indicators are calculations based on historic price, volume, or open interest information to predict asset price direction. 

	Fundamental analysis is analysis of stock's financia;s or operational details.

	Fundamental part of technical analysis is based on analyzing trends, chart patterns, price action, etc.

	Popular technical indicators:
		MACD: Moving average convergence divergence
			- difference between two exponential moving averages (closing price) (typically 12 period (fast) MA and 26 period (slow) MA)
			- signal line is also calculated (another moving average typically 9 day period) of the MACD line as calculated
			- If the MACD line cuts the signal line from below it signals a bullish period. If the MACD line cuts the signal line from above it signals a bearish period - Called a crossover strategy
			- This indicator creates a lot of false positives - especially during a sideways market
			- Should be used in conjuction with other indicators
			- lagging indicator - meaning by the time the signal is realized you're behind the market
		Bollinger Bands & ATR (Average True Range)
			- Analyzes volatility - considered volatility based indicators
			- Bollinger bands:
				- Uses two different plot lines
				- one is the standard deviation (of 2 over a 20 day period) above the simple moving average line and the other is the standard deviation below the simple moving average line
				- The bands widen during periods of increased volatility and shrink during reduced volatility
				- Typically when bands shrink it means there's potential to make some money
			- ATR:
				- Looks at ranges 
					- difference between high/low
					- difference between high and previous days close
					- difference between low and previous days close
					- take the average of all of those
				- Looks at price range over certain trading periods. Conveys how wildly the market is swinging
			- If ATR and Bollinger Bands are within a tight band it's highly likely a breakout or trend will start to form
			- If ATR is trending down it means volatility is decreasing and could mean something good is about to happen
			- Look for the squeeze!!!
		RSI: Relative Strength Index
			- A momentum oscillator which measures the speed and change of price movements
				- It analyzes the strength of the price value at a given moment compared to previous prices
			- RSI value oscillates between 0 and 100 with values above 70 indicating that the asset has now reached overbought territory and a correction is expected. Values below 30 signal oversold territory and the price is expected to go up.
			- Assets can remain in overbought and oversold territories for long durations. Meaning if it's over 70 you might think it's a good idea to short it but it might stay there for a long time.
			- Calculation follows a two step method wherein the second step acts as a smothering technique (similar to calculating exponential moving average)
		ADX: Average Directional Index
			- ADX is a way of measuring the strength of a trend
			- Values range from 0-100 and qunatifies the strength of a trend as:
				- 0-25: Absent or weak trend
				- 25-50: strong trend 
				- 50-75: very strong trend
				- 75-100: Extremely strong trend
			- ADX is non directional. Meaning it makes no inference about the direction of the trend but only the strength of the trend. 
			- The calculation involves finding both positive and negative directional movement (by comparing successive highs and successive lows) and then calculating the smoothed average of the difference
		OBV: On Balance Volume
			- OBV is a momentum indicator which uses changes in trading volume and an indicator of future asset price moves. Theory that volume preceeds price movement. So when volume increases price usually plays catch up.
			- OBV formulation is based on the theory that volume preceeds price movement. A rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices and falling OBV predicts decline in prices
			- OBV is a leading market indicator(meaning it preceeds the real world values) but prone to making false signals. It's typrically used in conjuction with lagging indicators such as MACD
			- OBV is calculated by the cumulative sum of volume traded adjusted for the direction of corresponding asset price move.
			- Rising OBV is a prediction that prices are going to go up.
		Supertrend
		Renko Charts
			- Renko charts are built using price movement and not price against standardized time intervals - This filters out the noise and lets you visualize the true trend. 
			- Price movements (fixed) are represented as bricks stacked at 45 degrees to each other. A new brick is added to the chart only when the price moves by a pre-determined amount in either direction.
			- Renko charts have a time axis but the time scale is not fixed. Some bricks may take longer to form than others depending on how long it takes the price to move the required box size.
			- Renko charts typically use only the closing price based on the chart time frame chosen.

Platform layout: # check Fidelity's dev tools for use cases
	- Drop down menu allows you to select market (Nasdaq/NYSE/etc.)
	- Drop down allows you to select different technical indicators
	- Heatmap of every stock in each market based on their performance for each technical indicator
	- Clicking on each stock in the heatmap shows details of that indicator/charts/etc.
	- Personal portfolio chart that shows daily gains / losses and gives lifetime average gains/losses - mostly use this to track success / failures of strategy
	- create training and testing data sets based on your trades. You'll have to start with an unsupervised model. But eventually you can create a supervised model with a label column of positive/ negative depending on how the trade performed and the features will be the technical indicators used in each trade. Might want to think about trying to use size of gains/ losses in label to create a more efficient trading algorithm
